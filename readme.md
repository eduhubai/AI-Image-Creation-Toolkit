# AI-Image-Creation-Toolkit

Welcome to the AI-Image-Creation-Toolkit! This repository provides all the tools you need to generate AI images on your computer or using cloud-based services. Whether you're new to AI or an experienced user, this toolkit will help you create stunning images with simple Python scripts.

## Features

- **Local Image Generation**: Generate AI images directly on your computer at no cost.
- **Cloud-Based Image Generation**: Leverage Hugging Face's API to generate images in the cloud, with up to 100 free images per month.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Speed up image generation by running scripts on Google Colab using free GPUs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- An IDE like VSCode or PyCharm (optional but recommended).
- A Hugging Face account for cloud-based image generation.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Image-Creation-Toolkit.git
   cd AI-Image-Creation-Toolkit
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries**

   If you're running the scripts locally, install the necessary Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install the following libraries:

   - **diffusers**: A library for creating and working with diffusion models used in image generation.
   - **transformers**: Hugging Face’s library for handling pre-trained models and running inference.
   - **requests**: A simple library for making HTTP requests, useful for accessing Hugging Face’s API.
   - **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, useful for image processing tasks like saving and displaying images.

## Usage

### 1. Local Image Generation

To generate images locally on your computer:

1. Open the `local.py` script in your IDE.
2. Customize the `prompt` variable with your desired image description.
3. Run the script.

The generated image will be saved as `output.png` in the project directory.

### 2. Cloud-Based Image Generation

To generate images using Hugging Face’s cloud API:

1. Open the `cloud.py` script in your IDE.
2. Replace `your_huggingface_api_token` with your Hugging Face API key.
3. Customize the `prompt` variable with your desired image description.
4. Run the script.

The generated image will be saved as `output.png` in the project directory.

### 3. Using Google Colab

If you want to leverage Google Colab’s free GPUs:

1. Upload the `local.py` or `cloud.py` script to a new Google Colab notebook.
2. Install the necessary libraries in the Colab environment:

   ```python
   !pip install diffusers transformers requests pillow
   ```

3. Run the script to generate your images faster using Colab’s GPU resources.
